            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Dear reader, the following article will detail my time at Clear 
                Software where I spent four months as a web developer during the winter of 
                2023. I thoroughly enjoyed my time and hope that this article gives you some 
                insight into what my day to day experiences consisted of and what exactly made
                 Clear Software such an enjoyable place to work at. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                &lt;About-Clear-Software/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Clear software is a relatively small company with two core developers
                 who have been leading the company since 2009. These two have been working together
                  for a long time and are brilliant developers, both attended Waterloo for their 
                  undergrads in comp-sci and math related fields. Clear also consists of a QA department
                   and depending on how many interns are present, the team ranges from 5-8 people in 
                   total. Clear Software is a custom<a id="goals"></a> software shop, creating solutions for whatever
                    platform or industry is required. The team has worked on significant projects
                     ranging from low-level hardware and robots to fully fledged and scalable web
                      apps. As for where I would be working, that would be in my office at home as 
                      Clear is currently operating fully remotely. Once upon a time they did have 
                      an office in the Waterloo region, but when Covid shut everything down that 
                      was no longer necessary.

            <h2>
                &lt;Goals/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Now that you’re in the loop regarding what Clear Software does, 
                let’s talk about what I wanted to get out of this term. Before the term 
                began I was tasked with producing some personal goals that would help 
                steer me during the next four months. I knew from prior terms that these goals 
                had to be well-suited to my time frame and they needed to be ambitious enough 
                that I could strive for them, but also not be too far away to the point that they 
                were unachievable. The following is what I came up with.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Become better at managing my time during working hours. I often struggled
                     to find the balance between working too much, or possibly not working 
                     enough throughout the day. Other pitfalls of poor time management 
                     included working too long without taking a break and eventually fatiguing, 
                     or staying up late/waking up early to chase down a bug that I was hooked 
                     on solving. My plan was to get serious about my time and consistently
                      take short breaks after ~30 minutes of very focused work. You might
                       think that seems ridiculous, who needs a break after only 30 minutes 
                       anyways. But, it’s something that’s worked for me and many other 
                       individuals, particularly while studying during exam season. 
                    <br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    Take on some significant chunk of a project or lead development on a 
                    large piece of functionality in a very independent way. This goal
                     has a lot to do with me wanting to “own” some part of the codebase.
                      It’s fun to be a bit of an expert on some area of the codebase and 
                      I think the best way to learn the ins and outs is to be there when
                       it gets created, or better yet, be the creator! 
                    <br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    Get better at understanding other people’s code and the way they write,
                     the patterns they use, then take that information and use it to improve
                      my own code. Similar to reading plain English, I think that it’s 
                      super valuable and important to be able to quickly and easily read other
                       peoples’ code. Some of the most skilled devs I know can pick up a random 
                       piece of scrappy looking code and tell you what it does in a matter 
                       of seconds, it’s like a super power. With Clear being such a small 
                       company, I think it will be important to write code that will blend 
                       in well. The idea here is to write code and not have anyone be able to 
                       tell who wrote it (without using git blame, cheater!). A seamless looking
                        code base would be easier for new people to read and makes maintenance easier too.
                    <br />

                </li>
            </ul>           
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;That summarizes my larger goals for the term, of course I also came up with 
                smaller ones week to week and day to day that helped me keep a solid learning 
                trajectory throughout the term. Now that we’ve discussed my goals for the term, let’s 
                talk about what I actually did.<a id="my-job"></a> 
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>
                &lt;My-Job/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;When I joined the team, Clear was in the later part of their
                 main development phase on their latest project, prior to anything going live. 
                 The project is a large internal web based tool for one of Canada’s largest 
                 structured settlement firms. This tool will end up handling thousands of
                  gigs worth of personal data and boasts a suite of very industry specific 
                  tools/workflows and internal management systems to help speed up the 
                  company’s various processes. I will also mention here that I worked
                   almost exclusively in the front end, with the occasional need to
                    work on some other areas of the code base.  
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;The stack consisted of MariaDB, Express, React and Node. 
                The fun part about all of this was that 99% of our communications 
                were done with GraphQL rather than REST APIs. I hadn’t worked with
                 GraphQL before, and all I knew was that the requests looked really 
                 weird in comparison to RESTful stuff. Nonetheless I was excited, 
                 the first week was fairly typical onboarding stuff. I got to sink
                  my teeth into the code base and was incredibly impressed. The lead
                   frontend developer had done a really really good job of writing
                    what appeared to be highly organized, clean, and maintainable 
                    code. This was very exciting as I hadn’t worked in a codebase 
                    this neat before.  
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;After the first week I got busy with some tickets, 
                I was really enjoying my time. My initial PRs often had some change
                 requests because the code base was so large, and I would end 
                 up writing new functions that were already written somewhere
                  else and I had just missed them. After a while I got the hang 
                  of things and my PRs went smoother, I felt like I was writing
                   pretty good code and I was absolutely putting a lot of effort 
                   in to try and make it look similar to the existing code. This
                    paid off I think, one of the comments during my exit interview 
                    was related to this and It was very positive feedback.  
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;After the first month and a half or so I got my first 
                big set of new feature tickets. This feature would consist of 
                a lot of UI additions and it would in essence be an internal
                 event manager that integrated with our structure of companies
                  and employees to help make managing invites easier. I had a 
                  lot of fun with this and it went well without too many hang ups.
                   I felt like I had done something cool and independent, and this
                    was some part of the code that I could absolutely own per
                     my goal up above.
            </p>
            <p>
                  &emsp;&emsp;I continued working on bug fixes and tickets for some time until 
                  a new request came up. The company this project is for has a 
                  current system that is outdated and lacking a lot of features, 
                  which is why they’ve commissioned Clear to write a new one. However,
                   one of the functionalities of this system that did work well, and would 
                   need to stick around was an automated reporting system, for various accounting
                    and analytics related reports. I got to researching new solutions right 
                    away as the old solution was written in Microsoft Visual FoxPro and would 
                    not be sticking around. After a couple of attempts and experimenting with
                     various solutions we wound up agreeing to use JaperSoft’s reporting tools.
                      They have a cool report building tool and you can easily spin up a 
                      reporting server and configure it to fire off automated reports.
                       I got part way through the implementation of this before my time was up, 
                       I hope that it all comes together nicely!  
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Overall, I really enjoyed the work at Clear. The automated reporting 
                researching/experimenting was probably my least favorite part as it was much 
                more reading, and much less coding. <a id="reflections"></a>I loved working on the events feature, 
                as I could bury myself in code for multiple days at a time. I guess this has 
                helped me discover some of the specific things that I do and do not enjoy. 
        <section>
            <h2>
                &lt;Reflections/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Remember those goals I mentioned above? It’s okay if you don’t, 
                they are my goals after all. Anyhow, let’s do a little reflecting on how I 
                did with those goals. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;My first goal was to get better at managing my time. A 
                big part of this I found was just being surrounded by distractions while working 
                from home. I removed a lot of the distractions, and set timers to take breaks 
                and it worked great, I spent less time futzing around and was more productive.
                 My second goal was to take ownership of a significant feature, I was able to 
                 achieve this with both the events feature implementation and the automated 
                 reporting research and development. I would say this was another successful goal.
                 My final goal was to get better at reading others' code, and take what I learned 
                 and implement it into my own code. I would also say this one was a success, 
                 I received multiple pieces of feedback throughout the term in PRs and meetings 
                 saying that it was very clear that I was making strong efforts to make code
                  that looked similar to everything that was already written. I think I was most
                   satisfied with this goal, since It was something that took some time and effort 
                   to get right, but once I got it, the team was able to appreciate my efforts.
                    All in, I consider this to be a very successful term.

            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, I had a great time at Clear Software. I enjoyed my work as 
                a frontend web developer, the tech stack was interesting and the work was rewarding.
                 I created what I felt were reasonable goals and achieved all of them, although
                  perhaps I should have been more ambitious with them. Something about shooting 
                  for the stars and landing in the clouds, being more ambitious would have raised 
                  the risk of failure but that’s probably necessary to grow more. I’ll keep that 
                  in mind for my next term as a software developer at Desire2Learn.
